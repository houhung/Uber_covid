Best you can do is park it in a garage when you\\'re not driving it. It\\'s been a lot of years since I saw a garage that was climate controlled.I used to rent a house that was like that.

I want the just refreshed 2021 model S. I\\'m not too concerned for depreciation_Tron_ said:OP, I have basically been doing the same thing as you for the past few years with a different brand EV, and it has worked out well. Many of the folks telling you not to do it have good reasoning (although some are out to lunch), but a key point is if you are going to buy the car regardless of if you drive Uber. To the degree you are depending on rideshare income to make the car payment you are leaning toward the negative aspects that people are pointing out. However, if you can make the payments sans any Uber income, AND you just want to drive a Tesla, then that strategy is more workable. You can have fun of driving the car while Ubering, and the income will help defray costs. Cost of ownership of an EV is remarkably low, especially if you charge overnight at discounted utility rates.I leased a Chevy Bolt EV in 2018, on the basis that I just wanted to drive an electric car, and that part-time Uber income would help pay for the car. Thankfully that plan worked out better than expected. Driving two days a week paid for virtually everything to do with the car (payments, insurance, tires, accessories, etc.) and even bought my groceries for the week.But this is 2021. More caution is required because the longevity of the rideshare companies is more in question than ever. I actually had a plan to buy a Model Y to cover that contingency, because Tesla may launch its own rideshare network with human drivers at the wheel for a while (in my view \"a while\" translates to many years). If Uber and/or Lyft falter, AND if Tesla gets its rideshare network act together, then you would potentially be in a strong position.For myself, I ended up cancelling the Model Y order and trading in my leased 2018 Bolt to outright purchase a 2021 Bolt. Why? GM gave me an offer I couldn\\'t refuse. I picked up a 40K car for 22K (inclusive of rebates) with 0% financing. This means my car payments are $350 /month rather than the $850 /month the Y would have cost. And, I still get to drive a fun EV and supplement payments with rs income, while it lasts. But I am not depending on the income.I am also very leery of Tesla build quality and service issues. People have been stranded for months with no car due to Tesla not channeling parts to its service network. That\\'s something else to factor in.If you do pull the switch and go with that Model S, you will be buying a car that has already proven itself as a workhorse for rideshare with Southern California based Tesloop. Although Tesla has stumbled on initial build quality, the vehicles really are well designed, and along with current battery chemistries, Tesla is well on its way to achieving its stated goal of a one million mile powertrain.Finally, anything you can do to FIX YOUR COSTS, such as GAP insurance, extended warranty, etc. is a GOOD thing. I keep my insurance deductibles very high to offset the extra costs. The presumption is that it is the other guy who is going to hit you. Naturally you want uninsured motorist protection, and in California you absolutely want the Collision Deductible Waiver, which costs pennies and prevents you from having to pay the deductible if an uninsured idiot hits you.Click to expand... I wouldn\\'t be depending on Ubers income at all. I can pay for the Tesla with my day job without a problem. I view this as I can buy a depreciating car and let it sit in my garage and not drive it or I can buy a depreciating car, drive it, and make play money. The uber money will just be a cherry on top. I also just realized I do get FREE charging at a decent charging speed rate (25 miles per hour) so now I am really leaning towards this.

On weekends I might drive longer yes but I usually go out drinking so either way I won't be using the car when I'm done driving for Uber because I myself will be taking an uber somewhere giving my car a lot of time to sit and charge.

Gas is over $3/gallon in most places. It's entirely wasteful to keep driving empty at that price.There was a thread a couple years back when I first joined UP.net that claimed Uber/Lyft won't send you pings if you're parked while logged in for accepting rides. This is utter nonsense. I park it every time I'm running empty. Sometimes, a ping will take awhile to materialize, but most times I'll be back driving within five minutes. There is zero truth to the rumor that Uber/Lyft blacklists you for parking it.The only time I will keep driving after dropping off the passenger is when I'm stuck in a remote location where no pings could be reasonably expected. This does happen on occasion. In that case, I'll drive towards the closest active region, and usually I'm getting a ping before arriving there.

I still think it's worth allocating a cost to them. Just my personal opinion.Click to expand...Before Uber, I was replacing my car about every 3-4 years. I'm at three years on my current vehicle, which is the only vehicle I've had while doing rideshare. It'll probably get replaced next summer or fall (2022) when used car prices come down. Now is an absolute horrible time to buy anything with four wheels.I paid $3,995 cash for the car in October 2018. I figure the trade-in value will be roughly $1,500 next year, give or take. That's $2,500 for what the car cost me, which also includes all the miles I've racked up commuting to work, getting groceries, taking day trips. Luckily, I've had no major repairs in three years of ownership. The only oddball expense I can attribute to the rideshare miles is my rear wheel bearings. They went out in July 2019, after some pretty hefty months of driving Uber/Lyft around that time. That was $150, because I paid my next door neighbor mechanic to do the work in cash. Saved me about $300 over what a shop would have charged. All other maintenance was normal-interval stuff unaffected by Uber/Lyft trips.So...a $2500 car that only cost me $150 in additional rideshare-related maintenance, and I'll tack on an extra $100 for the three extra oil changes I required over that time span, and $250 for the extra insurance premiums. So, $3000 invested in my car total over nearly three years. That's about $1000 the car is costing me for rideshare per year. And that's not even accounting for the fact I'd need a car anyway since I commute to work, run errands, and take personal trips with it. The actual expense ratio when pro-rated for rideshare miles is even lower.That's why I don't do rideshare as a career. It's good for a quick couple bucks here and there, but driving day-in and day-out makes the math far less favorable.\",\n",

Uber and Lyft shouldn't be one's sole source of income. The amount of wear and tear on your vehicle in a given year can really make this difficult at times.

The customer bears the cost of doing business.The article has a pay gate, but you can duck it with the \"X\" trick.As long as the TNCs continue to pay 1979 cab rates to drivers while charging the customers 1989 cab rates, drivers must avoid the unprofitable trips. Even when the TNCs are charging 1994 cab rates, such as a mild surge where the customer pays a 1,1-1,3 multiplier but the driver gets only base rates, still, the driver must avoid the unprofitable trips. Even under a surge factor of 1,9 or greater, even back in the days of multipliers to the drivers, still there were unprofitable trips. Those would be the trips that take you far from the surge zones.The deficient policies of the TNCs force the drivers to extraordinary measures to turn a profit.

Many of the folks telling you not to do it have good reasoning (although some are out to lunch), but a key point is if you are going to buy the car regardless of if you drive Uber. To the degree you are depending on rideshare income to make the car payment you are leaning toward the negative aspects that people are pointing out. However, if you can make the payments sans any Uber income, AND you just want to drive a Tesla, then that strategy is more workable. You can have fun of driving the car while Ubering, and the income will help defray costs. Cost of ownership of an EV is remarkably low, especially if you charge overnight at discounted utility rates.I leased a Chevy Bolt EV in 2018, on the basis that I just wanted to drive an electric car, and that part-time Uber income would help pay for the car. Thankfully that plan worked out better than expected. Driving two days a week paid for virtually everything to do with the car (payments, insurance, tires, accessories, etc.) and even bought my groceries for the week.But this is 2021. More caution is required because the longevity of the rideshare companies is more in question than ever. I actually had a plan to buy a Model Y to cover that contingency, because Tesla may launch its own rideshare network with human drivers at the wheel for a while (in my view \"a while\" translates to many years). If Uber and/or Lyft falter, AND if Tesla gets its rideshare network act together, then you would potentially be in a strong position.For myself, I ended up cancelling the Model Y order and trading in my leased 2018 Bolt to outright purchase a 2021 Bolt. Why? GM gave me an offer I couldn\\'t refuse. I picked up a 40K car for 22K (inclusive of rebates) with 0% financing. This means my car payments are $350 /month rather than the $850 /month the Y would have cost. And, I still get to drive a fun EV and supplement payments with rs income, while it lasts. But I am not depending on the income.I am also very leery of Tesla build quality and service issues. People have been stranded for months with no car due to Tesla not channeling parts to its service network. That\\'s something else to factor in.If you do pull the switch and go with that Model S, you will be buying a car that has already proven itself as a workhorse for rideshare with Southern California based Tesloop. Although Tesla has stumbled on initial build quality, the vehicles really are well designed, and along with current battery chemistries, Tesla is well on its way to achieving its stated goal of a one million mile powertrain.Finally, anything you can do to FIX YOUR COSTS, such as GAP insurance, extended warranty, etc. is a GOOD thing. I keep my insurance deductibles very high to offset the extra costs. The presumption is that it is the other guy who is going to hit you. Naturally you want uninsured motorist protection, and in California you absolutely want the Collision Deductible Waiver, which costs pennies and prevents you from having to pay the deductible if an uninsured idiot hits you.Click to expand... I wouldn\\'t be depending on Ubers income at all. I can pay for the Tesla with my day job without a problem. I view this as I can buy a depreciating car and let it sit in my garage and not drive it or I can buy a depreciating car, drive it, and make play money. The uber money will just be a cherry on top. I also just realized I do get FREE charging at a decent charging speed rate (25 miles per hour) so now I am really leaning towards this.

It's entirely wasteful to keep driving empty at that price.There was a thread a couple years back when I first joined UP.net that claimed Uber/Lyft won't send you pings if you're parked while logged in for accepting rides. This is utter nonsense. I park it every time I'm running empty. Sometimes, a ping will take awhile to materialize, but most times I'll be back driving within five minutes. There is zero truth to the rumor that Uber/Lyft blacklists you for parking it.The only time I will keep driving after dropping off the passenger is when I'm stuck in a remote location where no pings could be reasonably expected. This does happen on occasion. In that case, I'll drive towards the closest active region, and usually I'm getting a ping before arriving there.

I still think it's worth allocating a cost to them. Just my personal opinion.Click to expand...Before Uber, I was replacing my car about every 3-4 years. I'm at three years on my current vehicle, which is the only vehicle I've had while doing rideshare. It'll probably get replaced next summer or fall (2022) when used car prices come down. Now is an absolute horrible time to buy anything with four wheels.I paid $3,995 cash for the car in October 2018. I figure the trade-in value will be roughly $1,500 next year, give or take. That's $2,500 for what the car cost me, which also includes all the miles I've racked up commuting to work, getting groceries, taking day trips. Luckily, I've had no major repairs in three years of ownership. The only oddball expense I can attribute to the rideshare miles is my rear wheel bearings. They went out in July 2019, after some pretty hefty months of driving Uber/Lyft around that time. That was $150, because I paid my next door neighbor mechanic to do the work in cash. Saved me about $300 over what a shop would have charged. All other maintenance was normal-interval stuff unaffected by Uber/Lyft trips.So...a $2500 car that only cost me $150 in additional rideshare-related maintenance, and I'll tack on an extra $100 for the three extra oil changes I required over that time span, and $250 for the extra insurance premiums. So, $3000 invested in my car total over nearly three years. That's about $1000 the car is costing me for rideshare per year. And that's not even accounting for the fact I'd need a car anyway since I commute to work, run errands, and take personal trips with it. The actual expense ratio when pro-rated for rideshare miles is even lower.That's why I don't do rideshare as a career. It's good for a quick couple bucks here and there, but driving day-in and day-out makes the math far less favorable.\",\n",

What I did to solve the issue was simple --- I purchased a lumbar pillow for my auto. It worked for me extremely well. Auto seats tend to curve your spine the wrong way, and the lumbar pillow corrects it, putting pressure on your lower back to return it to the S curve where it's supposed to be. Now, I need to see a chiropractor, but the virus has closed their offices.\",\n",

IF that were possible.However, it really isn't sustainable economically.If 320 million people are given $400 per week, that costs $6.6 Trillion. But the government only pulls in ~$3 trillion per year. So you'd need to triple the taxes that are collected in order to make that work. That isn't going to happen.Click to expand...Excellent points as always Trafficat! I do NOT fault anyone for wanting UBI or taking UE and just sitting at home ( I learned long ago never to judge anyone ever), but you are right that if there was a generous UBI for the masses, then taxes will go up astronomically.\",\n",
       " \"DRider85 said:. If you are serious and you know what is best, then explain what that job is.Click to expand...I'd say another part-time job with a decent wage is your best bet. Uber and Lyft shouldn't be one's sole source of income. The amount of wear and tear on your vehicle in a given year can really make this difficult at times. If you can find a job in the 20-30 hour weekly range that pays better than minimum wage, you have a starting place.If you can handle the drunk crowd, drive Uber/Lyft on those nights only. That's when the surge is high and the tips are flowing. Your dollars-per-mile is much better on a Friday night, than a Tuesday afternoon. However, if you don't like obnoxious drunks, drive whatever timeframe puts you at ease. You'll probably just have to drive a little longer then.The bottom line is not to rely SOLELY on rideshare to pay the bills. If you can score a suitable part-time W-2 gig that represents more than 50% of your necessary income level, you are well on the way to making Uber/Lyft a functional part of your livelihood. Once you start relying mostly on rideshare to pay the bills, that's when the pain begins.\",\n",

The customer bears the cost of doing business.The article has a pay gate, but you can duck it with the \"X\" trick.As long as the TNCs continue to pay 1979 cab rates to drivers while charging the customers 1989 cab rates, drivers must avoid the unprofitable trips. Even when the TNCs are charging 1994 cab rates, such as a mild surge where the customer pays a 1,1-1,3 multiplier but the driver gets only base rates, still, the driver must avoid the unprofitable trips. Even under a surge factor of 1,9 or greater, even back in the days of multipliers to the drivers, still there were unprofitable trips. Those would be the trips that take you far from the surge zones.The deficient policies of the TNCs force the drivers to extraordinary measures to turn a profit. If the TNCs would pay something close to current cab rates and charge the customers more, they could justify keeping the destinations from the drivers. Until that day comes, drivers need to know the destinations, especially during surge pricing hours; especially given the Charlotte Surge/pay cut.Those of us who need to turn a profit need every means to avoid the unprofitable jobs.

Played a mobile game.I got out the car to look what was going on and find a cop and he was gone, tried inside the store, no sign.Waited more outside and had a support message that my support thread was being merged into another and then the other thread notified me I would be suspended and it investigated by the trust and safety team.Annoyingly I did not video this encounter with my phone as it was a male rider, lesson learned.I asked on the thread how long it would take but a day later, no reply.How worried should I be and are there any legal options I can pursue?My rating is at 4.95 and his was 4.71 if this helps at all.\",\n",

       " 'If you are driving for a living or even driving for compensation only part time, it pays you to get a traffic lawyer. Usually, these guys or girls can bust down the fine, have no points added and get you the equivalent of \"probation before judgment\". What happens is that you pay a busted down fine, plus court costs, if the state where the summons was issued charges court costs, and are on probation for a period that ranges from thirty days to eighteen months, depending on the state, nature of the violation and the judge. If you do not receive a summons during the probationary period, you will have the record expunged totally. If you are issued a summons and found liable, you will receive the full points for the offence and might even have to pay the full fine, depending on the state and judge.You may be able to deduct the cost of the traffic lawyer from your taxes, but, you would have to ask your tax accountant of some other professional who is qualified to dispense tax advice. I am not qualified to do that, but it is something into which you might look. The nature of your business requires that you contest any traffic summons, as traffic points can affect your ability to continue in that business. Check with a professional qualified to dispense tax advice to be sure on this, though.I was not aware that New York issued summonses for passing on the right.

It\\'s cold today, isn\\'t it?\"Everyone has met this type of person in social situations - people who have nothing to say for themselves whatsoever and who just expect to be able to go up to someone, ask awkward and inappropriate questions that are not suited to the situation, and expect the other person to just start rapping away.Back to the cocktail party situation.Do you (a) excuse yourself and get away from the creep as soon as possible or (b) answer the barrage of questions and continue to engage him so that he may ask you more invasive personal questions?I get that the inquisitor pax is not in a social situation with the driver; it is a transactional situation between service provider and customer. So why try to make it a social situation in which one tries to find out personal information about the other? It\\'s just not appropriate, and it\\'s crossing a line.By all means, small talk is fine. I have had pax who have had very interesting things to say, which have led to very interesting conversations. Pax may comment on the music I am playing, we realise we are both fans, and we talk about that. Or the pax may share that he works in IT, and we end up having an interesting (for us IT geeks anyway) conversation on cloud-based vs. legacy systems. All of this is fine.
